## Introduction

At our company specializing in student loan refinancing, accurately predicting borrower repayment behavior is crucial for providing competitive interest rates. To achieve this, our team aims to create a model capable of predicting the likelihood of student loan repayment. Leveraging machine learning and neural networks, we'll utilize a dataset containing information about previous student loan recipients to build a predictive model.

## Features

- Predictive Model: Utilize machine learning and neural network techniques to build a model that predicts the likelihood of student loan repayment.
- Dataset Analysis: Analyze the provided CSV file containing information about student loan recipients, including credit ranking and other relevant features.
- Business Impact: Enhance the company's ability to provide tailored loan refinancing options based on individual borrower risk profiles, ultimately improving customer satisfaction and reducing financial risks.
